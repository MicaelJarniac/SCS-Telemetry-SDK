# SCS-Telemetry-SDK
A 'fork' of SCS Telemetry SDK from https://modding.scssoft.com/wiki/Documentation/Engine/SDK/Telemetry

SCS provided an SDK to simplify reading telemetry data from their truck simulators, Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator, but apparently only provided it on downloadable archives, and not on a repository with version control.

This is an attempt to change that, by gathering those archives and putting their files under a Git repository.
