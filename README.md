# SCS-Telemetry-SDK
A 'fork' of SCS Telemetry SDK from https://modding.scssoft.com/wiki/Documentation/Engine/SDK/Telemetry

SCS provided an SDK to simplify reading telemetry data from their truck simulators, Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator, but apparently only provided it on downloadable archives, and not on a repository with version control.

This is an attempt to change that, by gathering those archives and putting their files under a Git repository.

You can find the original SCS Telemetry SDK files under the branches with their respective versions, like `scs_sdk_1_11`, and their archives in the [archives](/archives) folder.

To download them straight from SCS, you can use the following URL, modifying its end for the version you want to download:

```
http://download.eurotrucksimulator2.com/scs_sdk_<VERSION>.zip
```

For example, for the 1.11 SDK, the URL is `http://download.eurotrucksimulator2.com/scs_sdk_1_11.zip`.

On the master branch of this repository, there'll be some tweaks focusing on enhancing its documentation or maybe even code changes, but it should still be compatible with the original releases.
